# HackTheDf

## Theme
The theme was music related and as an aspiring musician
and being the son of a man in a band

I have been learning guitar and more specifically the bass for a couple years

The hardest part of learning those instruments is memorizing the fretboards and the order of the notes

With this app you can study where the notes are on a virtual fretboard

Since it randomly pulls the note from an array it assists in studying 
and since you can find multiple of the same notes on the fretboard it only resets the note when you choose

For a couple of reasons I made an app that I wish I had when I begun my guitar journey

## How To
To use the app run the included requirements.txt folder with the command: $ pip install -r requirements.txt

After running this command you can run the app with: $ python3 gui.py
